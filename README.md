# Cyclistic Bike Share – Customer Behavior Analysis

## Business Summary
Cyclistic is a bike-share company in Chicago with over 6 million users across 690+ stations. Its users are categorized into two segments - Casual riders (Those who use single-ride or full-day passes) and Annual members (Those with annual subscriptions)

## 🚨 Business Problem 

Cyclistic aims to increase its overall revenue, and one of the most effective strategies is converting casual riders into annual members. However, the company currently lacks behavioral insights into why casual users are not making the switch — thereby creating a gap in its ability to develop targeted and effective conversion strategies.

## 🎯 Objective
As a data analyst, my task was to analyze and understand the behavioral differences between casual riders and annual memnbers so as to inform marketing strategies and drive membership growth. By understanding the behavioral differences between these two rider groups, the marketing team can design targeted strategies to convert casual riders into loyal, paying annual members.

## 🔍 Key Business Questions
1. How do ride durations differ between casual riders and annual members?
2. What time of day, days of the week, or season of the year are most popular for each rider group?
3. What is the prefered route, start and end stations between both rider group and what does this imply?

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Annual members demonstrate consistent, year-round usage of the bike-sharing service. Their rides are concentrated during typical commuting hours, with popular routes connecting residential areas to business districts and transportation hubs. They primarily use the service for efficient, shorter trips, as evidenced by their shorter average ride durations. Their behavior indicates a reliance on Cyclistic for daily transportation needs.
  
- Casual riders, in contrast, exhibit a more seasonal and leisure-oriented usage pattern. Their ridership peaks during the summer months and on weekends, with trips often originating from stations near recreational areas and tourist attractions. Casual riders take longer rides, suggesting they use the service for exploration, recreation, and longer leisure trips

## 🎯 Recommendations
- Offer a discounted or free trial annual membership, specifically targeted to casual riders during their peak usage times. This will allow casual riders to experience the benefits of membership during their preferred riding times, directly incentivizing them to convert to a full annual membership.
  
- Develop a marketing campaign that highlights the value of an annual membership for exploring the city. This campaign could feature curated top 10 routes, user-generated content showcasing unique city experiences, and testimonials from annual members who use Cyclistic for both commuting and leisure. This campaign would reframe the annual membership as a key to unlocking ongoing exploration and adventure, appealing directly to the casual rider's desire for discovery and making the membership relevant to their lifestyle.
  
- Use data to personalize incentives for casual riders to convert to annual memberships. For example, offer discounts on longer rides for a limited time, or provide a one-time credit towards a membership after a certain number of leisure rides. By tailoring the incentives to match their riding behavior, Cyclistic can make the value proposition of annual membership more compelling and relevant to individual casual riders.
